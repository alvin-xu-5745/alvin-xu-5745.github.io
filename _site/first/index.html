    <h1>First Post</h1>
<p>
    15 Sep 2020
  </p>
<p>As my first actual project, I am developing and putting up this personal website.</p>

<p>On this website, I will be putting up various things I do that I want to make publicly visible. At the moment, this primarily includes three things - my computer science projects, my music projects, and a blog. In the future, this may expand to include other things.</p>

<p>The projects will just be demonstrations of my programs and showcases of my music, but the blog is more of an open and creative pursuit. Here, I will post about anything that I feel is worth talking about, whether that be showing recently explored computer science or musical ideas that I find interesting, or just talking about some recent experience I’ve had. As such, blog posts will definitely not be something I post on a regular schedule.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons that I want to make this website:</p>

<p>First, the development process will teach me a lot about web development. As a relatively inexperienced programmer, it is good for me to get as much experience as I possibly can. For now, this is a static website with nothing but front-end elements, but in the future I want to experiment and add more functionality into this site.</p>

<p>Second, I predict the blog in particular will provide me great benefits in a variety of ways. One is that I can write about my thoughts and my life. I always think it is a good idea to keep some journal of some kind like this so as to document one’s life. I can talk about anything I find interesting to an ‘audience’, even if no one actually reads the posts. Writing these posts will also help me improve my writing capabilities, which is something I want to work on but don’t get many opportunities to practice.</p>

<p>Third, the site will be helpful by providing me with a web presence. I think it is useful to be able to collect all of my work into one area - it makes it easily accessible for anyone interested. For instance, I won’t have to link to my GitHub to show my programming work, and then my Youtube to show my music.</p>

<p>These reasons combined are what push me to make this website. I want to get this up as soon as possible so it is there for my access whenever I need it, and so that I have more time to gain the educational benefits of working web development and to make more posts on my blog.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
