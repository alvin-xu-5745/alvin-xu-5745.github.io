I have posted my first produced track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDeySoLGZW0" target="_blank">here</a>. I did technically make something months ago, but that was more of me following along with a tutorial. This was my first purely original creation.

Overall, I learned a lot from working through this. I'll split my discussion over this piece into the three parts of the song.

The intro is a lot quieter than the rest of the piece. I tried to go for that feel when a piano introduces the piece and instruments begin to layer on to make it more intense. Percussion immediately gives it some initial energy. As for the underlying strings chords, they aren't even an actual thought-out chord progression. I just layered strings in the key to fit the bassline and tweaked it until I thought it sounded right. The electric bass and accompaniment figure that get introduced are there to make it a little more energetic.

The second part is where I think the biggest issues lie. It's supposed to be something of a bridge to the final melody, but I don't think it serves as a good transition from the first part or to the last part. The melody itself is fine, but I think the biggest issue with this section is that it doesn't have any groove. I find myself following along with the big beats, not along some syncopated pattern that you would find yourself bopping to in a good song. The guitar accompaniment makes this section too melodic and relaxing, which sounds fine but doesn't work to establish its position in the piece. The overall phrase should have a higher BPM to create more energy. The percussion is really what carries all the intensity at the moment. Additionally, I probably should have put some string fillings here just to take up some of the space.

The final part is actually what I made first. The main melody has been well-established for months now, and I am quite happy with. However, the rest of the instruments needs to work well for the melody to really pop, and I don't think I perfectly hit the mark I was trying to go for. The problem again is that it doesn't have groove - the energy is all on the big beats, with little syncopation. I went with a VI -> VII -> v -> i progression, which keeps the energy up, but I definitely should have made the strings louder to fill up more space. I really like the electric guitar solo I put in, but don't like how the guitar itself sounds - I need to practice more with sound editing.

Overall, I am pleased with this first track, but there's a lot for me to learn from it, and by writing this post I can properly outline what those are. 

First, the biggest issue with the track is that it doesn't feel groovy enough. There are many potential fixes to this, the main ones being to raise the BPM, add more intense instruments, and to have more syncopation. The instruments are definitely an important part - I hardly used any synth lead sounds, for instance, and those can really give energy. The syncopation is definitely also a really big part - syncopated phrases, syncopated accompaniment rhythms, syncopated percussion, all serve to make the piece feel a lot more energetic.

Second, it feels kind of empty. Empty is fine if it's supposed to be a calm piece, but my intention here was to make an intense track. An easy fix to this would be to add string fillers where they're missing, and also make them more audible. I lowered them too much out of the idea that they're only background, and now they're pretty much inaudible beyond the first section. I also can add more instruments, even if just to double up some phrases, to fill up space.

Third, the mixing and instrument sound design. My inexperience with production shows, and unfortunately the only way for me to get better at this is to keep trying over and over. I was able to do good mixing in some parts, such as highpassing the trumpets so that they weren't covering everything, but overall there are still a lot of obscured instruments that I need to bring out more. One thing I want to focus on is getting a clean electric guitar sound - I love that instrument, but not when it sounds like it does right now.

I don't know when I'll make my next track because college and its related tasks really just always give me something that I need to do, but I'll try my best to work on a new and imrpoved track when I can.

Until next time!
