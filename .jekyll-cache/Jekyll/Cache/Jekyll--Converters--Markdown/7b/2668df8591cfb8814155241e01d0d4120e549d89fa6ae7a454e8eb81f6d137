I"<h1 id="first-post">First Post</h1>

<p>As my first actual project, I am developing and putting up this personal website.</p>

<p>On this website, I will be putting up various things I do that I want to make publicly visible. At the moment, this primarily includes three things - my computer science projects, my music projects, and a blog. In the future, this may expand to include other things.</p>

<p>The projects will just be demonstrations of my programs and showcases of my music, but the blog is more of an open and creative pursuit. Here, I will post about anything that I feel is worth talking about, whether that be showing recently explored computer science or music ideas that I find interesting, or just talking about some recent experience Iâ€™ve had. As such, blog posts will definitely not be something I post on a regular schedule.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons that I want to do something like this:</p>

<p>First, the development process will teach me a lot about web development. As a relatively inexperienced programmer, it is good for me to get as much experience as I possibly can. For now, this is a static website with nothing but front-end elements, but in the future I want to experiment and add more functionality into this site.</p>

<p>Second,</p>
