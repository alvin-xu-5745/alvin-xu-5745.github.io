I"y<p>My studies at UC - Berkeley began on August 26, 2020. It is now September 26, 2020, one month later. Given the unique circumstances that my university experience has begun under due to the ongoing pandemic, I figure it would be a good idea to recount my experiences so far. I want to clearly outline what impact the virtual medium has had on my experience.</p>

<p>I technically have been studying here for longer than a month, since I took a course over the summer. Nonetheless, it has been one month since the fall semester, and all the campus activities that come with it, has officially begun.</p>

<p>First, the classes.</p>
