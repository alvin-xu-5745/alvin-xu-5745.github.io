# Music

I like to compose music in my free time! I primarily make game-style soundtracks.

My youtube channel can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVA5pm63XaxuFmDghnX3gUw" target="_blank">here</a>. All my work will be posted here.

At the moment, I am working on a collaborative project with a small group of other composers, expected for a December release.

I also have another collaborative project expected to release sooner.
