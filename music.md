# Music
<br>
I like to compose music in my free time! I primarily make game-style soundtracks.

My youtube channel can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVA5pm63XaxuFmDghnX3gUw" target="_blank">here</a>. All my work will be posted on this channel.

At the moment, I am working on a collaborative project with a small group of other composers, expected for a December release. I will also release my part of the project independently on my channel.

I also have another collaborative project expected.
